- if files with code already exist, you can go into the folder and type <b>npm init</b>
- This will initialize the <b>npm package manager</b> for that project (after you answer some of its question)
- then you can start installing the packages you need for the project such as tailwind, shadcn etc using npm
- make sure to delete the node_modules folder after your done with development and want to share the code.
- the node_modules folder can be generated using the <b>npm i</b> command inside the folder.

<b>Note</b>: CommonJs is the default in nodejs which is the older way of writing code. Ecmascript is the newer version. Just changing the type to module in package.json will convert commonjs to ecmascript.
