- When a variable is declared and assigned a new value it is called <i>Initialization</i>
- Javascript naming convention uses <i>camelCase</i>
- <i>innerText</i> can be used to retrieve and manipulate texts inside html elements. <i>{in details inside the javascript notes}</i>
- <i>onclick</i> method can be used in buttons to trigger certain events or logic.

function goStore() {<br>

button1.onclick = goStore;

</code>

wraps the word Store in double quotes without throwing an error.

Just like array values, object properties are separated by a comma


- one can pass in objects as arguments in a function
