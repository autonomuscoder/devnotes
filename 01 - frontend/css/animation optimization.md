While there isn't a direct way to pre-load CSS animations themselves, several techniques can achieve a similar effect and improve animation performance:

**1. Preload Animation Resources:**

- **Images:** If your animations use background images within keyframes, consider preloading them using the `<link rel="preload" href="image.png" as="image">` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML. This ensures images are downloaded early, preventing delays during animation playback.
- **Fonts:** If animations involve text with specific fonts, preload those fonts using the `@font-face` rule with the `font-display` property set to `swap` or `optional`. This instructs browsers to prioritize loading the font, enhancing animation smoothness.

**2. Optimize CSS Delivery:**

- **CSS Placement:** Place your animation stylesheets **after** critical content in the `<head>` section. This prioritizes rendering essential elements before loading animation styles, preventing content from jumping around as animations load.
- **Minify and Compress CSS:** Minifying and compressing your CSS files reduces their size, allowing them to download faster and improve animation performance.

**3. Consider JavaScript-based Techniques:**

- **Lazy Loading Animations:** Use JavaScript to dynamically add animation classes to elements only after the content has loaded. This approach ensures animations don't block initial page rendering. Libraries like Intersection Observer API: [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver) can be helpful in this scenario.

**4. Server-side Optimization Techniques:**

- **HTTP/2 Server Push:** If your server supports HTTP/2, it can automatically push critical resources, including animation stylesheets, to the browser before the user explicitly requests them. This can significantly improve initial load times and animation smoothness.

Remember, the best approach depends on your specific project requirements and complexity. Experiment and measure different techniques to find the optimal solution for your website's performance.
